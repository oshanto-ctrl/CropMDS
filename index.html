			<h3>Our Goals...</h3>
    <p>Precision Farming merges the new technologies 
	borne of the information age with a mature 
	agricultural industry. It is an integrated crop 
	management system that attempts to match the 
	kind & amount of inputs with the actual crop 
	needs for small areas within a farm fields.<br><br/>
    Crop management practices for the safe use 
	of salt-affected soils and saline water primarily
	nsists of growing suitable salt-tolerant crops, 
	managing seedbeds, and grading fields to minimize
	local accumulation of salts, soil management, 
	improving irrigation efficiency and soil, water, 
	and salinity monitoring for assessing leaching 
	and drainage requirements.<br> <br>

	Crop management begins with the sowing of seeds,
	continues with crop maintenance during growth 
	and development, and ends with crop harvest, 
	storage, and distribution. 
	During seed sowing, a mechanized planter 
	often opens a furrow in the prepared soil 
	seed bed, places the seed in the exposed moist 
	soil, covers the planted seed, and then often 
	packs the soil down to assure firm seed-soil 
	contact. In no-till systems, the crop is 
	planted (“drilled”) directly into the soil 
	through residue from the previous crop. <br> <br>
	
	With the help of digital technology, 
	we can keep track of different crop bed 
	statistics. we can monitor them in real-time 
	and store them for future use. we can also take 
	future decisions based on this data and  improve 
	our cropped management tecknic. there are also 
	possibility of automation system using this data set.<br> <br>
